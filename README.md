CIT 360-03 Person Journal
Week of Sept 13th:
This week was the first week of school and well, I was actually out on holiday. I traveled South to see my family. 
It was great, but I also did worry about my classes. I brought my laptop with me and tried to do as much homework 
as I possibly could. In fact, the only homework I was not able to get done was a lab for one of my other classes 
because my laptop didn’t have enough to run it. My rig at home however would be able to and I couldn’t get my SSH 
to work so I could install it and get what I needed. 

Week of Sept 20th:
This class is pretty different from all of my other classes that I’ve had in the past. I’m kind of grateful that 
it is among my last classes needed. I’m just really scared that I may fall behind or that some of the 
homework/projects I won’t understand. This week’s elevator pitch was kind of rough because I really had some good 
ideas and they weren’t coming to mind when I wanted them. I also wasn’t sure if we were looking for a web-based app 
or a mobile app. I was able to post an idea, but I’m not quite sure how it will take. I haven’t gotten any comments 
or responses.

Week of Sept 27th:
This week was chaotic in my life and I felt as if I'm struggling already. Too many things going on that has crippled 
my way of doing things. I pray that next week will be better. In any case, my group met twice and it was great to be 
back in a group and trying to get the pieces to fit properly. I was a little inadequate, but I'm sure next week I'll 
be back on the ball. I learned a lot of new things and I'm excited about learning and putting to use. Discussing our 
thoughts and trying to find an agreement on things was fun and enjoyable. 

Week of Oct 4th:
This week I have been doing some reading on the User Interface Hooks and it kind of overwhelming, but I think I'm 
beginning to understand it better. I think the toughest part I'm coming across is trying to place clips in the team 
community. I'll have to ask for some help, but for now, I think I'm exhausted from it and will take a little break. 
I'm learning a lot about the Google tools. I'm fascinated by how useful and the amount of settings and applications 
that are available. Our team seems to really mesh well and the cogs are turning really well. I can see good things 
coming from everyone. Good stuff

Week of Oct 11th:
This week I learned about JSON and how it works. I thought it was really interesting how simple it can be, but how 
deep the rabbit hole can go with creating objects within objects. The link below is a playlist for a tutorial that 
I think explained it really well.
